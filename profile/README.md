## Tracks

In this track, we have provided 5 problem statements for participants to solve. Participants are expected to build a project from scratch that addresses one of the provided problem statements. Teams can choose to work on any of the problem statements. Teams are free to use any web/app technology stack.

The Problem Statements can be found [here](https://github.com/Credenz-Web-Weaver/pubmatic-problem-statements "here").

### Track 2: Open Source Royale
